Harriet Lane served as the First Lady for her uncle, President James Buchanan, from 1857 to 1861, and James A. Garfield had a successful career as a politician, lawyer, and amateur mathematician, becoming the 20th President of the United States in 1881 before his assassination later that year.

In conclusion, while there are no unusual or unexpected connections between Harriet Lane and James A. Garfield based on the provided data, their individual contributions to American history are well-documented and significant.

Test #2 : Harriet Lane and James Buchanan
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is a direct correlation between the two. She was his niece and First Lady while he was President.
There are multiple possible stories to write about them. Her destiny changed because of him, and the other way around. A boat was named after her, etc.


Ideas : Harriet Lane performed several unusual or unexpected roles as First Lady, given that she was the niece of a bachelor president. These roles include:
*******
1. Serving as the First Lady despite not being the wife of the president, which is an unusual position as First Ladies are typically the wives of the presidents.
2. Promoting social causes, such as improving the living conditions of Native Americans and supporting the arts, which was unexpected for a First Lady at that time.
3. Being recognized as the first of the modern first ladies due to her notable charm, diplomatic skills as a hostess, and influence on fashion with her dress-styles being copied.
4. Leaving funds in her will for a new school on the grounds of Washington National Cathedral, showing her commitment to education and community development, which is an unusual role for a first lady who is not the wife of the president.

These roles demonstrate how Harriet Lane, as the niece of a bachelor president, took on responsibilities and made contributions that were not typical for First Ladies of her time.
